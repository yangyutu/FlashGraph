1) How CPUs access the SSD array? 

2) Can one CPU aceess all the SSDs at the same speed?

3) How main memory is used for large scale computation (where the data cannot fit into the memory)

4) How data is partitioned among the SSDs?

5) How the computation tasks partitioned among the multiple CPUs?
